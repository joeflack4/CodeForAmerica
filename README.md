# Building Violations Data
Thank you for checking out this repo! This project was written in the context of an existing Flask App.

## How this code is organized.
The core logic is in violations.py. It is split into subsections: a. dependencies, b. csv upload logic, c. a violations model, d. logic.

The front-end html template is also included, with subsections: a. boilerplate, b. csv upload ui, c. data table, d. pie chart.

## How to run this code.
As this code is written to be presented in web application context, neither running the python file locally nor opening the html file in the browser will work. See below for viewing live.
