Dear Code for America,

Thank you for reviewing my application! I have been waiting quite some time for applications to open back up. I wanted the opportunity to share the results aesthetically and easily, so I wrote this in the context of an existing Flask App. The core business logic (violations() within violations.py) took approximately 30 minutes.

1. How this code is organized.
The core logic is in violations.py. It is split into subsections: a. dependencies, b. csv upload logic, c. a violations model, d. logic.

The front-end html template is also included, with subsections: a. boilerplate, b. csv upload ui, c. data table, d. pie chart.

2. How to run this code.
As this code is written to be presented in web application context, neither running the python file locally nor opening the html file in the browser will work. See below for viewing live.

3. Viewing the live data visualizations.

Thanks again for considering me to be a fellow! If you wish to see a more full view of the code in context of the live application, please see: http://www.github.com/joeflack4/vanillerp
